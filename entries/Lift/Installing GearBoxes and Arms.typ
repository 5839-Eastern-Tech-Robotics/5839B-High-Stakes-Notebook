= Lift arm design
For each of the 2 powered arms we used a 17.5in 2 wide C-channel for low weight with a high reach. At one end their is a bearing flat and the others a shaved down HS gear used as a lock bar. The Lock-bar ensures that the arms rotate with the axel they are attached to allowing the motors to control them. For the two passive arms the design was the same except the lock-bar was replaced with just a bearing flat as the passive arms did not need to move with a motor.

= Gear box connections and 3d printed guide
To link the new gearbox into the PTO a 12t gear needed to be added onto the axel. To ensure this axel was strong enough a bearing flat on the opposing side had to be added; however the bearing flat needed to be in a spot that did not line up with any of the holes on the C-Channel. In order to make sure the holes were in the perfect spot a 3-d printed guide was once again made and successfully used to drill the off-set holes. The gear and axel were then slid through the bearing linking the PTO and gearbox together.

= Problems to brainstorm on
After the gearboxes were attached we began to stage sprockets and could not yet determine if it were better to include them on the inside or outside of the robot. On the outside they might be more exposed to hits from other robots, but on the inside they interfere with the brain and other parts so it would require some re-building.
