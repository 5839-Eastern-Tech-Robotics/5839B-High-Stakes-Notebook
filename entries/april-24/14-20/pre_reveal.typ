After watching the conclusion of the World Competition, three of us—Davis, Praful, and Andrew—began to theorize ideas and strategies for the new game. These ideas were created before the release of the rulebook, and new ideas will be documented upon its release.

Initially, the similarities to the previous games of Round Up and Tipping Point provide a wide variety of strategies to draw from, such as:

- Pneumatically grabbing a mobile goal (MOGO)
- Using an intake to place rings on a held MOGO

In addition, some unique ideas were discussed, such as:

- Using a D4Rb or similar lift to raise and lower the intake to deposit at the variable elevations where the stakes reside
- Having a pneumatic grip on the intake to grab the top bar and pull the robot off
- Creating a descoring device to remove rings from a goal
- Having at least 4 or possibly 6 motor drive to have enough power to hold the corners when needed

Multiple ideas relating to strategy were also discussed:

- Climbing is far more valuable compared to previous games due to the reduced point values of the rings compared to previous objects.
- Securing the corners is critical, as they could flip a game in an instant.
- Having a way to only put your rings or the enemy's rings onto a goal quickly could prove valuable.
- One could make a MOGO with only enemy rings just for it to be put in the descoring corner.
- The top ring seems pointless if it is only worth three points, as going for it would require precision and a good amount of time that could be better used elsewhere.

Some ideas for decorating the robot and field were also discussed:

- One could draw the popular video game character Kirby or a face in general on one of the rings.
- The top ring is the "One Ring to Rule Them All," allowing for multiple Lord of the Rings references, such as calling the robot "The Eye of Sauron."

Overall, we see this game as being far more complex than previous games, requiring more advanced mechanisms and a higher level of quality for a robot to be competitive. We shall begin prototyping some models in Inventor the following day and adjust when the rules are released. We are also interested to see if there will be any big differences in skills compared to the base game.
