We started by building the basic intake modeled in Inventor and worked to create various improvements as we encountered problems. (It is important to note that these tests were done with a 3D-printed ring, so the weight issues encountered may not be entirely accurate.)

Initial tests using a standoff intake similar to those in Tipping Point showed that the chain flexed and dropped the rings because they were too heavy. To adjust for this, flexwheels were tested and found to work very well. However, as we increased the incline of the intake, the flexwheels became less effective at picking the rings up from the ground, though they still carried them up once the intake secured them.

To alleviate this, standoffs were added to the center of the initial stage of the intake. This helped, but it occasionally caused jamming, which was fixed by making the first stage of the intake float. This allowed it to rotate and enable the disk to enter more smoothly. After multiple changes to the gripping devices, a final design was settled on. (Picture of different intake rollers/chains with descriptions and charts of each one's ability to intake.)
