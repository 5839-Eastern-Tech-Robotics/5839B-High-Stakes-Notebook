= progress
The building of the second drive half was slowed down as we used it to help teach the two new members the basics of building. Once it was finished it was temporarily connected to the other half with c-channel as we were cautious to drill the HS axels. 

= Drive test results
The drive was tested and it was found to our dismay that the drive was built too close to the ground and when the wheels sank slightly into the field the motors began to drag. To fix this a very quick solution was found. When flipped upside down the drive still worked as intended and the motors had sufficent clearnce with the ground. A few parts of the PTO had to be flipped to ensure clearnce, but otherwise this solution allowed for smooth driving.
