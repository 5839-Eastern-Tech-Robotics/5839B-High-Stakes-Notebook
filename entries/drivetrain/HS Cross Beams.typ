= Drilling HS axels
We chose to make the cross beams out of HS strength axels due to their unmatched strength to weight and size relative to steel and aluminum c-channel. However with this strength it also makes them very hard to work with specifically drilling into. It is very hard to get a good pilot hole into the steel which is needed to get accurate holes. To alleviate this a custom 3d printed guide was created. This slides over the axel and provides a pilot hole to get the drill started. Each hole is one time use as the drill melts and deforms the plastic, but this is not an issue as they print very quickly. This idea was inspired by our previous 3d printed guide for the motor bracket used previously that worked greatly

= Using the Guides
We slid the guides on and positioned them at the proper measurements. They were highly successful and all 9 holes were drilled with only one hole being slightly of center from the beam. After this the beams were attached to the drive halves and the spacing checked with a ruler to ensure the holes gave the proper spacing between the two halves. From here we began to test different methods of attaching the air tanks in the area designated for them. We tried standoffs coming from the bottom and sides to hold them in place along with zip-ties. We settled on having the tanks zip-tied to the vertical standoffs we added for now, but this is subject to change. We also installed the brain which uses shaft collars and standoffs to put it at an angle in order to make it accessible, but also not block the intake area.
