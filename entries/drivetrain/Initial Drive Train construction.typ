= Drive Train Model
At home Davis finsihed the drive train model in inventor so that work could begin building it today. The core desing behind the model is having 8 3.25 wheels which were chosen to help lower the center of mass comapred to 4in wheels. In addition using the optimal speed calcualtor excel chart created by team (find team name) we chose a speed of 400rpm for the drive. To power this 6 blue motors were chosen as the blue cartiges have less slop in them compared to the red and green ones. Two motors (one on each side) are conencted to the drive with a PTO in order to hoepfully power a lift in the future as well as provide extra drive power. This was done as a 6 motor drive was considered essential especially since the robot with be fighting over the goals constantly. A PTO was chosen as any motors used on the lift would not be in constant use and therefore would be wasted most of the time so the PTO makes the best use of the limited motor budget. There is also room for the pneumatics to fit in along with the battery in the middle to keep the center of gravity lower so the robot does not tip or jump during acceleration.

= Build progress
All the parts needed to build the drive were taken out and sorted on the back table. So far the wheel spacing is correct and rotates smoothly and one half of the wheels has been tested and assembled. Next the plan is to build the motors and half of the pto to test spacing and friction.
