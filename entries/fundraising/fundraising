During a group meeting today, we discussed a variety of fundraising methods. All ideas were listed on the right side of the board (even jokes), and the potentially viable ideas were written on the left. A fundraiser would provide us with early access to the field, allowing us to get more practice. During the previous year, the team worked with a 3D-printed tri-ball and a makeshift field made from old parts until around November. To avoid this, a fundraiser that raises at least six hundred dollars would allow us to secure the field months before the county might decide to purchase it for us.

Out of the many options we considered, we decided to try a simple GoFundMe campaign and send it to our families. This would require minimal input while offering the possibility of a large output. We promised that any donors would receive a resin-printed Eastern Tech keychain to encourage more donations. All team members sent out the link to friends and family to raise funds.
