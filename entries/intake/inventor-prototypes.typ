To start, an intake with a lift was modeled along with initial ideas for the drive. This was done so that we had a good starting point to begin building when we met again later that week. Additionally, the drivetrain allows us to start making considerations for motor distribution and the sizing of our manipulators.

The intake is designed to use a chain belt with standoffs screwed in that will hook onto the center of the rings and pull them up, as well as the lift to drop them off at various heights on the stakes.

The drivetrain includes a variety of features, some of which had been worked on during the preseason:

- 6-motor drive with a PTO to transfer two of the motors to a lift.
- 4 3.25-inch omni wheels for traction and maneuverability.
- Vertical motor mount to save space.
- HS axles used to secure the two halves of the drive.
- Pneumatics with Lexan washers used to shift the gears in the PTO.
- Odometry sensors to allow for an improved and more accurate autonomous routine.

Overall, this is just a quick model put together and will be further explored as the season continues and we begin to construct the robot.
