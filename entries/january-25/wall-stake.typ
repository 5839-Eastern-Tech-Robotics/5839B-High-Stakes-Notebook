After the competition at Loyola, we saw how substantial and important the wall stakes were to a match. Our performance at Loyola this year was by far our best out of the 3 seasons we've participated in so far. Although it wasn't perfect, we made it to the quarterfinals again where we faced off against the 1st seat. Their team among many used wall stakes to their advantage as you could score on them if you weren't contending a positive corner. We saw a similar design of the intake feeding into a U-shape that would hold the ring and then an arm that would rotate into the wall stake


This was by far one of the more difficult parts of the robot to add since we needed to incorporate it into our intake while still remaining in the size constraints. An issue we encountered was that the intake would often get stuck after lodging the ring in. On top of that, the rign would usually slip off when the arm swung it onto the wall stake. It took a lot of trial and error to get our wall stake to work


Our final design for the wall stake was a combination fo the many different designs we saw at the robot. We still stuck to the basic U-shaped ring older but we also added these little arms that stick out that are wrapped with mesh. The mesh helps to hold onto the rings better and prevents slippage. We've used a high strength axle that goes through much thicker pieces of C-Channel.
