We were hoping to use some of the engineering budget to aid us in constructing and designing the robot, but sadly that budget was cut to 0 due to the overall engineering budget cut. This will limit our flexibility and options when ordering parts for the robot, as well as make cuts to parts based on priority.
By prioritizing, we mean to plan to order and design for what we believe will be the final design based on efficiency, functionality, and how well the design follows the limitations and rules.

summary:
- engineering budget got cut to 0
- less flexibility and narrows options
- emphasized priority on the draft because of increased limitations
