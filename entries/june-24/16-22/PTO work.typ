= PTO work
We met up today to finish the PTO on the drive train. At the moment the HS axel crossbeams are yet to be added as we want to finalize the PTO first. We started trying to fit the current washer design into the system, but found it had reliability issues. To adjust this anew bracket was designed, a template pritned, and a part cut on the bandsaw. Once it was isntalled we tested the ability of the pneuamtic to pull and push the gears and found it did require the gears to rotate a little if they were uanligned, but otherwise it was very smooth. We did notice one side was smoother then the other, but it did not seem to be an issue so it will not be adressed for the time being.
