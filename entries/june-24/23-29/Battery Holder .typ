= Shrinking Gear Boxes
While testing if the battery holder located inbetween the motors in drive worked it was found to be 1/8" to small. To compensate and provide ample room for it to slide in each gear box was shrunk by 1/8" by removing spacers and reducing the standoff length between the two sides of each gear box. After this we tested the new holder width and the battery fit perfectly so we could work on the HS cross bars next time.
