= Lift frame
We began to attach C-Channel to both sides of the robot in order to start prototyping how the d4rb lift would attach. We went with 3-wide C-channel so that we could use ball bearings to reduce the friction. We also made a guess of what the spacing between the two lift bars should be at 6 holes, but this is easy to change once we design and attach the lift arms/intake. Next we will work on the prototyping a gearbox to connect the PTO of the drive to the lift in order to power it. Once the lift is powered we will attach the arms and then onto those arms we will place the intake to complete the majority of the design.
