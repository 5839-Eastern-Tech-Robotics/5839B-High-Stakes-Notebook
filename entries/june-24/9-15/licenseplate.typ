= Concept
To start the summer off fun we wanted to create a more artistic asepct of the robot. Vex allows for lots of freedom with the red and blue lincse plates diplayed during the comeptition. The plates also have to be quickly swapable in between matches and should look as cool as possible. Our design has the plates double sided and rotate about a point. Their is a slot in the point where they rotate that allows a tap on the plates to be pushed down into to stop their rotation. This would allow them to be quickly flippable and we would not have to carry around spare plates. Also we used a vector image to get a model of our school logo onto the plate and imported a fitting font to make a far better looking plate then what vex provides by default

= Creation
The idea is that the plates will be 3d printed in Davis's resin printer. This will provide a 4k quauity to the part ensuring the logo and letter look as goods as they do in the model. We can then spray paint this part red or blue and then color the letters and logo white with a paint marker
