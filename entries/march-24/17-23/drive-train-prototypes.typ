With inventory taken we can now begin to make some designs. To expirment with more complex Drives a Mechnum drive and a Swerve Drive module were completed. These should provide good practice for designing before the next season as well possibly giving us a head start if we choose to use these drives. 

The first model made was that of a Mecanum Drive:

- 4 Mecanum wheels geared to 300 RPM with a 72:48 ratio driven by an 11w motor with the 600rpm cartrige. 

- 24in HS axels with holes drilled in them as the main frame to ensure it was stronger then our previous drive trains.

- Center Omni Wheel for additional power

- PTO to allow for the cneter omni wheel to power other system while not in use

- Battery and Air Tanks kept low to ensure a proper center of gravity

- New Odometry Sensor fitted in the rear

Before we could enter school to test this I created a Model for a Swerve Drive module:

- Keeps design compact with motors below the frame

- 72 tooth gear is screwed to the frame so they spin together

- Circular insert within the gear to allow the drive shaft to turn

- Chain runs to connect the Drive Shaft to the 11w motor

- 5.5w motor used to turn module

#admonition(type: "note")[
  It is unlikley any of these drives will be used as tank drives have proved superior for many games in a row. They simply serve as a way to practice building and design techniques and mechanisms before the next season. However, cataloging them is still important as the ideas learned from them could prove very important.
