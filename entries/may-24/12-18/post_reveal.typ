To the entire team's surprise, the rulebook completely changes how the game is played compared to our initial thoughts from the video. Davis, Brandon, and Praful discussed these on Discord the night it was released.

New Rules

- The vertical expansion limit makes the previous lift models too tall, but not out of the picture, as elevating the intake could still help with climbing and depositing rings.
- It is required to go rung by rung to climb, greatly increasing the challenge in doing so, but the point values still make it worthwhile.
- The expansion limits do make the high stake worth far less, as scoring it would require climbing to the top rung and then having a mechanism to score it for only 3 more points.

Skills

- The rules regarding the different rings make it valuable for the robot to be able to sort out colors in its intake to ensure no rings are wasted.
- The corners are still valuable for the 5 points per MOGO, but not as crucial for the game.
- Descore mechanisms could help remove the pre-scored blue rings for more points.

Final Thoughts for the First Robot

- 6-motor drive
- Intake on a lift
- Pneumatic clamp to grab MOGOs
- Clamp on intake/lift to grab the first rung
- Passive clamps to hold onto the climbing rungs so that the lift can raise and grab the next rung
- Descore mechanism to help in skills and matches
