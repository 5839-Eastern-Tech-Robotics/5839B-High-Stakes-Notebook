= Summer plan
It was decided that due to school rules it would permit more time in the summer to work in one of our garages. Davis owns a Bandsaw, belt sander, and 3d printer so we would have access to nearly all the tools we would need. The plan is to pack up all the parts like we would for a competion and then add extra stock materials into a bin to take with us. This should provide ample supplies to protoype a nearly complete robot over the summer. These are to be taken to Davis's garage on the 31st the last day we are staying after this year. We have also decided to begin packing now as work has slowed from AP exams and a general growing tiredness among members as the school year ends. 

= Packing progress
All the comeption bins were filled to be taken and stock materials were layed out. Due to no limit on what could be taken all full length stock C-Channel and axels were taken along with any above 12.5 in in length. No tools were packed yet as those were still in use by Mr Hoge for his engineering and Maker Space classes whom we shared a room with.
