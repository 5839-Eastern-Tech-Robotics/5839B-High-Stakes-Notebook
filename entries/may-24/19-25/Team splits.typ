= Current Team Structure
At the moment our organization has just one team, but due to a large increase in members we plan to have two teams this season. 


= New plans
We want to try and allocate the needed skill sets to each team to ensure their own success. A possible team split was drafted on whiteboards with all current members and two prospective members Arkadeep and Logan in attendence. We made sure there were no major disagreements on teams rosters; however these plans are subject to change based on what freshmen we can recruit next year and what skills they possess.
