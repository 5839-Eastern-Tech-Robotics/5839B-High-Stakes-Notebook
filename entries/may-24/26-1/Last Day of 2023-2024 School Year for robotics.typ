We talked with Mr Brady about our general plan for the summer and with Mr Hoge about sending him a parts order around july as that is when he gets access to the shcool's engineering budget. We plan to use our inventorying spread sheet and current design to deterime what parts and in what quantiies to order. 

After this we made sure everything was packed and loaded it into the Davis's Dad's car to take back to his garage for the summer.
