= Spacing issues
While building out the drive it was found that the nuts on the bearing plate for the motors interfeared with the nuts on the bearings for the wheels. This plate was used to keep the drive as compact as possible again focused on our weight centralization idea. It was suggested to flip the nuts, but they had to go certain direction to keep the size down for the drive so they could not be flipped around. After brainstorming for some time it was decided the bearing flats could be sanded to half height so that the nuts would not stick out as far. This was found to work perfectly and the plate was screwed on and right drive half tested. The friction was a bit high around the PTO's shifitng gear, but it otherwise ran very smoothly so it was decided to begin buidling the second half of the drive. 

= Screw Joint
To adress the friction while Cole and Brandon worked on building the second drive half I replaced the axel the PTO was on with a screw joint which greatly reduced friction. A screw joint is an new technique we had learned online so this gave us a chance to test it. It works by using a logn screw that is bolted down and having a gear spin around the screw. This is often better then the square axels as a circle spins around a circle betetr hten a square around a circle hole; however the screw joint can not be used when you want two objects on the axel to spin togetehr with the axel so it has limitations.
