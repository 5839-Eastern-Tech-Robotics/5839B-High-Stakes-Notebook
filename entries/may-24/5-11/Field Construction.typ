= Set Up
Before we began to cosntruct the field we removed and replaced two tiles that we had damaged during the previous year. In addition we took apart and reassembled the wall of the field to adress stability issues present in previous years. Once this was done the field was ready to haev the new games assmbled

= Assembly
This took about two hours with members from both B and D working on it. It was very quick as the 4 wall stacks and 5 goals were very quick. Most of the time was spent making the middle ladder and testing with rings as we built in order to consider ideas. 

= Observations
The field was far stronger then previous years indicating our extra measures to reassemble the frame and repalce tiles were worth while. In addition the goals are far lighter then expected making picking them up easier then first thought. Our ideas on the ladder remain similar, but we did find that a 5-wide c-channel is almost the same width as one side of the triangular beams making them a candiate for a hook or arm to grab the ladder.
