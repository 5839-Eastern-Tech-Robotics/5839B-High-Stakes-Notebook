After a small break because of increased schoolwork, we finally got around to testing the climbing capabilities of the lift. To do this, we placed increasing amounts of weight on the lift, in the position where the lift would rest on the tower, to see if we could lift enough weight to carry the whole robot.

This would be unlikely as the robot weighed 10 lbs already and was likely to grow heavier, nevertheless we went on to test. The lift managed to carry 7 pounds, an impressive showing, however this was not enough to carry the robot, so the climbing was out.

Even more tragically the testing sheared a vital gear in the lift mechanism, and we lacked spares. Furthermore, VEX was out of stock for 36 tooth gears, and our lacking funds prohibited us from making that purchase even if we could. So we decided that our best course of action was to remove the lift intake mechanism altogether. This is because the ability to score on the neutral stakes was completely removed, and the ability to score on mobile goals was severely diminished. 

To remove the lift, we marked the position where the intake was most reliable when scoring on the mobile goals, and designed a plastic bracket with holes in the precise position where the intake needed to be mounted.

This allowed us to both increase the reliability of the intake as there were no vibrations from driving, and freed up the PTO for future use.
