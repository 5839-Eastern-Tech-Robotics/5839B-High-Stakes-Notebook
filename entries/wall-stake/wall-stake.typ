After the competition at Loyola, we saw how substantial and important the wall stakes were to a match. Our performance at Loyola this year was by far our best out of the 3 seasons we've participated in so far. Although it wasn't perfect, we made it to the quarterfinals again where we faced off against the 1st seat. Their team among many used wall stakes to their advantage as you could score on them if you weren't contending a positive corner. We saw a similar design of the intake feeding into a U-shape that would hold the ring and then an arm that would rotate into the wall stake
